# System Overview - Natural Match iOS

## How the LLM "Team" Works Together

This document outlines how AI assistants collaborate on the Natural Match iOS project to ensure consistency, quality, and efficient development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Mission
Building a modern, SwiftUI-based iOS dating app that connects people naturally, focusing on authentic connections over superficial matching.

## ðŸ¤– AI Team Roles & Responsibilities

### 1. **Product Manager AI**
- Maintains `prd.md` with clear product requirements
- Prioritizes features in `backlog.md`
- Ensures alignment with user needs and business goals
- Makes product decisions and trade-offs

### 2. **Architect AI**
- Maintains `architecture.md` with system design
- Ensures code quality and best practices
- Reviews technical decisions
- Maintains SwiftUI patterns and iOS conventions

### 3. **Developer AI**
- Implements features from backlog
- Writes clean, maintainable Swift/SwiftUI code
- Follows architectural patterns
- Updates documentation as needed

## ðŸ“‹ Workflow Process

### 1. **Before Starting Work**
- Read `prd.md` to understand product vision
- Check `backlog.md` for current priorities
- Review `architecture.md` for technical constraints
- Understand existing codebase structure

### 2. **During Development**
- Follow established patterns in codebase
- Update backlog items as completed
- Document architectural decisions
- Maintain code quality standards

### 3. **After Completing Features**
- Update relevant documentation
- Mark backlog items as complete
- Note any architectural changes
- Prepare for next iteration

## ðŸ”§ Technical Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use SwiftUI best practices
- Maintain proper separation of concerns
